# HappyTech

A software for recruiters was developed as a part of the MOD003262 Software Engineering module. A company HappyTech is growing and advertises a significant number of positions. Therefore, the number of applications they have to deal with is increasing too. The company’s policy is to respond to both the successful and unsuccessful applications by sending them feedback. As writing up letters for every applicant takes a lot of time, the company identified an ontology that could be used by a software application to generate the feedback. The feedback application will be used by anybody involved in reviewing the applications.


1. Create a template

• create a template to review applications for various positions advertised.
• These templates have a header with information about the applicant, the person writing the feedback and the feedback being used for CV/interview.
• Template have a list of pair of codes for each section and can include comments for each of these codes.
• This template lets one review applicants for more than one position. 

2. Edit template

• Select a template and edit the feedback for an applicant.
• Save the feedback as a PDF file and in the system so that it can be
sent to applicants. 

3. Delete template
• Delete a template from the list of templates created.

4. Generate feedback

• As a user, I want to generate feedback so that I can provide applicants with a constructive evaluation.
• Selecting a checkbox or radio button should let me access the section with the codes from the template selected and generate the comment.
• There should be a textbox where I can make free comments as well. 

5. Send Edit and Delete feedback

Before the feedback writing process starts, the template to be used has to be selected. The feedback window contains the header, the sections with the codes that can be selected via checkboxes or radio buttons and a text box for free comment. The feedback is saved as a pdf file using the applicant’s code or name. Email the applicants their feedback(s) so they can receive their feedback efficiently.Edit feedback so that I can make changes to the feedback details.There is an option to delete a feedback as well.
